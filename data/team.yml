  bio: |
    By day, I'm a web and iOS developer. I specialise in the Ruby on Rails
    framework, and have been dabbling in it for the past decade. I do quite a
    bit of iOS work now, too, though. In particular, I've been getting into
    Swift over the past couple of years, which I really enjoy working with. I
    haven't found the excuse to build a HomeKit app yet, but I'm working on it!

    As for messing around with home automation, I've been doing that off-and-on
    since I was a teenager. I've built interfaces to interact with the outside
    world from my BBC Model B, and my auld PCs running Linux. I mess around
    with Arduinos and Raspberry PIs for fun. I've got scars on my fingers from
    accidents with a soldering iron!

    When I'm not geeking out with bits of hardware or cranking out code, I
    really enjoy a spot of indoor rock climbing. You can often find me hanging
    around the local climbing wall, trying to conquer my latest project!
